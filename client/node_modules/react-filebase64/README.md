# React File Base64
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react) Component for Converting Files to base64. It's based on [Dev Mozilla Website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader/readAsDataURL)

[DEMO](https://rawgit.com/BosNaufal/react-file-base64/master/index.html)

## Important
This package is a fork from [Naufal Rabbani](https://github.com/BosNaufal/react-file-base64)'s original package. It seems like he's not maintaining it, and hence, this package was created instead so that other users could use it, as it seems the feature is highly requested. All credit for the core and base logic goes to him. All I did was correctly fix the code so that it would work correctly when importing as per noted in issue [here](https://github.com/BosNaufal/react-file-base64/issues/1).


## Install
You can import [react-file-base64.js](./src/js/components/react-file-base64.js) to your react component file like [this](./src/js/components/app.js) and process it with your preprocessor.

You can install it via NPM
```bash
npm install react-filebase64
```


## Usage
```javascript

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import FileBase64 from 'react-filebase64';

class App extends React.Component {

  constructor() {
    super()
    this.state = {
      files: []
    }
  }

  // Callback~
  getFiles(files){
    this.setState({ files: files })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <FileBase64
        multiple={ true }
        onDone={ this.getFiles.bind(this) } />
    )
  }

}


ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"))

```

## Props
##### multiple (Boolean)
Does your component support multiple files?

##### onDone (Function)
Callback function when all files have been processed
